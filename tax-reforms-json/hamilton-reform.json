// Eliminates Phase-In (This caused problems in the past)
// Phase in rate for 0 kids, 1 kid, 2 kids, 3+ kids (Changed to 0 because EITC_basic_frac + EITC_rt must be less than 1), maybe that will fix error. But if I get an error try eliminates both of these
// Phase out thresehold for 0 kids, 1 kid, 2 kids, 3+ kids (This is where it goes to 0, not where it starts phasing out)
// Additional phase out for married filing jointly (didn't change status quo)
// Max EITC credit for 0 kids, 1 kid, 2 kids, 3+ kids (Change this to the poverty line)
// Phase out rate need to calculate based on slope from povery line to median income
// Starting with this, we'll see if it works
