* TCPOVERTY: STEP 3
* RUN REFORM THROUGH TAX-CALCULATOR CLI
* Ernie Tedeschi
* Last Updated: 21 March 2019

* In this step you will need to run
* both a baseline and a reform sim
* through Tax-Calculator's CLI using the
* datafile created in Step 2b.
*
* For example, from a terminal, run these commands:
*
* tc c17_taxsim.csv 2017 --dump
* tc c17_taxsim.csv 2017 --dump --reform 'policy.json'
*
* You may need to add directory structures to the file names 
* if all the data and reform files are not in the same 
* directory.
