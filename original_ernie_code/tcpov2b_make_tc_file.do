* In this step you will need to run
* Tax-Calculator's built-in taxcalc.sh 
* script on the c17_taxsim file created
* in Step 2A.
*
* For example, from a terminal, run these commands:
*
* cd '~/Tax-Calculator/taxcalc/validation/taxsim'
* ./taxcalc.sh c17_taxsim save
*
* The commands may vary depending on your OS.
